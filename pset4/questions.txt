0.  JPEG, PNG supports 16.8 million colors, GIF supports 256 colors, BMP supports over 4.2 billion colors 
1.  GIFs support animation
2.  A lossy compression makes the file smaller while sacrificing data. Lossless compression makes the file 
    smaller using an algorithim so nothing is lost and the full data can be retrieved
3.  A JPEG is lossy compressed
4.  Essentially the metadata for that file is deleted, but the byte configuration existent in the memory remains the same.
5.  Use proprietary software to overwrite the entire drive with null values or randomized values, which hopefully erases 
    all traces of your file. This does not necessarily get around the Gutmann issue raised in the article though.
6.  It's a C library that contains functions for working with ints.
7.  These naming conventions leave little ambiguity as to the size and scope of each object type.
8.  1, 4, 4, 2
9.  BM
10. bfSize would be the size of the image plus the header while biSize is the size of the header
11. This means the origin is in the top left corner (positive or negative changes how the image is rendered in the bmp)
12. biClrUsed
13. Perhaps the user does not have write permissions in that directory
14. Because we are using fread to only read in 1 element at a time (hence always a 1 for the third argument)
15. Padding would be 3
16. Fseek allows you to move to a new pointer in your program using offsets to data positions in your program 
(e.g. beginning of the program, the current location of the program, or the end of the program)
17. SEEK_CUR refers to the pointer position at the current location of the program. SEEK_CUR is then offset using fseek
18. Rick Astley!
